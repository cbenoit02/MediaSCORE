<IntNotes>Primarily covers performances, rehearsals, and workshops at GMWA meetings from 1992-1995 (Chicago, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Atlanta, and Los Angeles) as well as interviews with participants. Also includes performances and workshops by gospel groups in Zomba, Malawi (cass 1910-1916), a memorial services for Edward Smith and a funeral service for Mattie Moss Clark of Detroit, MI, and a service at the Light of the World Chuch in Indianapolis. Some documentation of events in Indianapolis (7 cassettes), but most likely to be of interest to researchers studying GMWA history and black gospel music. Probably not much widespread appeal.</IntNotes>
<ContScore>2.4</ContScore>
<ContNotes>Probably the most thorough aural documentation of GMWA conferences and participants from 1992-1995, but given the wide temporal and geographic scope of these 71 cassettes, the amount of coverage of any one event is unlikely to be extremely thorough.</ContNotes>
<RareScore>4</RareScore>
<RareNotes>There may be other recordings of the GMWA rehearsals and performances, but this is extremely difficult to ascertain. There are unlikely to be many, if any, recordings with the interviewees. Malawi recordings recorded same decade, but earlier than Clara Henderson’s research on gospel music and may be of different communities.</RareNotes>

Includes important figures such as Ewart Abner, Al Bell, James Brown, Frankie Crocker, Dr. Hepcat, Jack Gibson, Tom Joyner, and many more.

<IntNotes>Interviews with R&amp;B musicians and record company personnel during the creations of Seymours pop music criticism columns and his biography on Luther Vandross, the latter of which includes discussion of Black gay culture/discrimination. Definite research potential for minority and LGBT-related research, although perhaps not as much widespread interest as there would be with interviews on more generalized topics. No real use as of yet, but could be due to access issues (i.e., no finding aid, cataloging record, or online collection description). Some big figures like Mick Jagger, Etta James, John Mellencamp, En Vogue, Chaka Khan, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, Mary Wilson, etc.</IntNotes>
<ContScore>2.5</ContScore>
<ContNotes>Many of the interviews are short and discuss specific performances, albums, collaborations, etc. for the purpose of supporting Seymour’s column. The quality of some of the interviews is “sketchy” and some are difficult to follow. Not many interviews related to Vandross and Black gay culture, which would probably would have been of most use to researchers.</ContNotes>
<RareScore>3</RareScore>
<RareNotes>Possibly some overlap with other interviews, particularly the interviews focused on artists’ recent or upcoming albums. Since specifically performed to fact check/fill out columns and the biography, the information is likely to be duplicated in Seymour’s publications.</RareNotes>

<IntNotes>The collection consists primarily of interviews with internationally well-known Dayton Funk musicians, their relatives, teachers, and local business owners. Conducted by AAAMC staff for the exhibit Something in the Water: The Sweet Sound of Dayton Street Funk at the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center in Wilberforce, Ohio. Several researchers have made use of this collection for presentations and publications.</IntNotes>
<ContScore>4</ContScore>
<ContNotes>Interviews are with significant members of the Dayton community (including the former mayor) and Dayton funk musicians (Zapp, Slave, Dayton, Ohio Players, Heatwave, etc.). Interviews are generally well done and interesting.</ContNotes>
<RareScore>4.8</RareScore>
<RareNotes>Interviews were performed to address a dearth of information on the influence of Dayton as a middle-class Black community on its role as an unusual regional source for the rise of an intensely successful popular music scene and the influence of local culture on the lyrics and music. Possibly some overlap in other interviews with musicians, but mostly new information.</RareNotes>

<IntNotes>Primarily documents blues performance—particularly from the perspectives of club managers and audience members—In both black and white cultural settings including Bloomington, Chicago, and to some extent Indy. Potentially of some interest to those researching Bloomington businesses and music scene because of interviews with local club owners and radio personnel. Also includes interviews with a few notable blues musicians, audiences, as well as guest lectures, performances, and radio broadcasts. Also a few recordings of lectures and festivals in Ghana. Would score lower if not for Bloomington content.</IntNotes>
<ContScore>2.4</ContScore>
<ContNotes>Tapes created as part of dissertation research. Oehler’s interviews are okay and contain some interesting details, but are not stellar.

Many of the transcripts are summarized and incomplete, depending on what the researcher found important to her research.

Hi, Patrick and Jason—
 
I found the Village Mothers tapes.  They got stuck on a shelf and haven’t been copied yet, but contrary to our finding aid, they do exist, and I will make copies of them, and they should be put into the queue for digitization.  This project (#100) gets a 3.6 for subject interest (it discusses courtship, birth, and childrearing practices in villages of Russian and Tatar women), a 4.0 for content quality, a 4.8 for rareness, and a 4.0 for documentation (because there is a book called Village Mothers by David Ransel for which these interviews formed the basis).  These are all original tapes.
 
Please let me know if you need any other information.
 
Cheers—
Barbara</GeneralNotes>
